The *Conf√©rence sur l'Apprentisage Automatique* (CAp) is the key annual event where the French-speaking community gather to discuss and exchange about the latest developments in the field of machine learning. This year, it is organized by the Data Intelligence team of the Hubert Curien laboratory in Saint-Etienne.


For this 2021 edition, we will present on June 15th our work on *Adversarial Dictionary Learning* which frames the learning of multiple adversarial perturbations as a sparse dictionary learning problem. We will illustrate why this framework can bridge the gap between specific and universal attacks. The presentation is available [here](https://chaire-raimo.github.io/2021_CAP.pdf).
